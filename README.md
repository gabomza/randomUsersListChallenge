# Things to improve

- Use a form manager to ease the creations and validations
- Use a CSS framework to reuse components in a better way
- Add i18n
- Add unit tests

## Users List

- Check the filter method to see if it can be improved
- Sorting: Add the ability to sort using more than 1 field, with the corresponding UI and data structure
- Update user data: consider future changes to allow more fields to be updated

## User Card

- Separate form component
- Same considerations as above for card shown data and information update
- Improve form creation and validations

## Modal

- improve styles and add more logic (if necessary)
